# SRC-leaderboard-overlay
An overlay do with python without the api (my first project)

SRC leaderboard project :

When you will lance the program, they will ask you a color for the background, the text color and the time between each change

For choose the game and the category :
- go to the page of the leaderboard, choose your category and copy the link
- in "leaderboard_link.txt" type ONLY THE LINK

Type the color and the time that you want :
- there is colors by default, by typing the number that is to the left from the color
- if you type the number for "other" they will ask you the code Hex (you can convert here : https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp)

If you type "6" the program will take the information that is at "color_param.txt" :

In the file type :
- background_color : #the color you want (in Hex)                
- text_color : #the color you want (in Hex)                  
- time between each change (sec) : the time you want (in second) 

/!\ Don't forget the spaces in the "color_param.txt"

/!\ the program work only on window

/!\ This is my first project (there are probably bugs)
 
/!\ I do not speak english very well
